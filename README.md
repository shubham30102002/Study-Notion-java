3. Why we need to implement Serializable

In Java, implementing Serializable means the class can be converted into a byte stream so it can be:

sent over a network,

stored in a file or cache,

or put into HTTP sessions (in web apps).

In Spring Boot, why do DTOs often implement Serializable?

Session replication: If your app is deployed in multiple servers, session objects (DTOs) must be serializable.

Caching (e.g., Redis, Hazelcast, Ehcache): Serializable helps when storing DTOs in distributed caches.

Messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ): Sometimes you need objects to be serialized when producing/consuming messages.

JPA Entities: While not strictly required, itâ€™s a best practice to make them serializable for persistence frameworks.

ðŸ‘‰ For DTOs: itâ€™s mostly best practice. It doesnâ€™t hurt, and it ensures your objects are future-proof if you ever need to cache/transfer them.
